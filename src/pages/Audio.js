							Commitment to quality is important at NZXT and we have an amazing
							community that holds us accountable if we stray from that
							commitment.
						</p>
						<p>
							In late September of 2019, the NZXT AER Headset, STND, and MXER
							were not living up to the quality standards that we strive for.
							Weâ€™ve decided to go back to the drawing board to make them even
							better.
						</p>
						<p>
							The good news is, weâ€™ve partnered with a new manufacturer that has
							taken on our audio product line and shares our passion for
							creating high-quality productsâ€”no compromises.
						</p>
						<p>
							As of today, we are officially canceling the currently announced
							line of audio products. Weâ€™re hard at work on a new audio line and
							weâ€™ll share more with you in our pursuit for perfection.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thanks for your continued support and patience. Following through
							on what we promise is critical to usâ€”we promise to deliver an
							amazing audio experience and we look forward to sharing updates
							with you along the way.
